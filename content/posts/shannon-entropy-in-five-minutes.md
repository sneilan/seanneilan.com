Shannon Entropy is used to produce a number that represents complexity of a probability distribution.

It gives a number in measured in bits to represent how many possibilities there are at each level of a tree.

$$
H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i) \log_2 p(x_i)
$$

Fundamental limit of data compression?

Nats vs Shannons.
